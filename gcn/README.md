# Graph Convolutional Network

Re-implemented for paper [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJU4ayYgl) in Pytorch. 

## Results
|Description    |Citeseer|Cora  |Pubmed|
|---------------|--------|------|------|
|Renormalization|66.0    |74.1  |76.3  |

## Parameters
Keep same as the original paper 

## Data
Three classification tasks with a graph-structure net: citeseer, cora and pubmed. The split of training, valization and testing is the same as original paper.
